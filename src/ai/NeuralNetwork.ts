    Purpose: This file is expected to contain the implementation of a neural network, a 
    core component of deep learning. In the context of your Tic Tac Toe game, the neural 
    network could be used to approximate the Q-values of state-action pairs, especially 
    in complex scenarios where maintaining a discrete Q-Table becomes impractical. This 
    approach is known as Deep Q-Learning.
    Functionality: The neural network takes the game's current state as input, processed 
    through one or more layers of neurons to output the Q-values for each possible
    action. Training this network involves adjusting its weights based on the error 
    between the predicted Q-values and the Q-values calculated using the Q-learning 
    update rule. Over time, the network learns to predict the most rewarding actions 
    for any given state.
