QTable.ts

    Purpose: This file likely contains the implementation of a Q-Table, which 
    is a fundamental concept in reinforcement learning. A Q-Table helps the AI
    learn and store the values (Q-values) of taking certain actions in specific 
    states, guiding it towards making decisions that maximize the cumulative 
    reward over time.
    Functionality: The Q-Table represents a table where each row corresponds to 
    a possible state in the game, and each column corresponds to the possible actions 
    the AI can take in those states. The values in the table (Q-values) are updated as 
    the AI learns from its actions' outcomes. This learning process is guided by the 
    Q-learning algorithm, which iteratively updates the Q-values based on the reward 
    received for actions taken, the learning rate, and the discount factor for future rewards.
