This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Agenda

Next Steps for Building Machine Learning AI for Tic Tac Toe

Here's a proposed agenda to integrate a machine learning AI (specifically, a reinforcement learning agent) into your Tic Tac Toe project:
1. Design the RL Agent

    Define State Representation: Decide how you will represent the Tic Tac Toe board as a state in your RL agent. This could be a simple string or array representation.
    Define Actions and Rewards: Determine what constitutes an action (e.g., placing a mark in a cell) and set up a reward system (wins, losses, draws).

2. Implement the RL Agent

    Create the RLAgent Class: Implement the class with methods like constructor, chooseAction, updateQTable, train, and getValidActions.
    Initialize Q-table: Start with an empty Q-table where you'll store the Q-values for state-action pairs.

3. Train the Agent

    Simulate Games for Training: Write a script or method to simulate games where your RL agent plays against either a random strategy or another fixed strategy. Each game is an episode.
    Update Agent's Learning: After each game/episode, use the updateQTable method to adjust the agent's strategy based on the rewards received.

4. Integrate the Agent into Your Game

    Import the Agent: Import the RLAgent into your game's main logic file.
    Agent as a Player: Modify the game logic to use the RL agent for making decisions/moves for one of the players (e.g., Player O).

5. Testing and Evaluation

    Play Against the Agent: Test the game by playing against the trained RL agent. Evaluate its performance and decision-making.
    Iterative Improvement: Based on the testing, you might need to go back and adjust the learning parameters, reward structure, or other elements of the RL agent.

6. Optimization and Refinement

    Enhance Training Process: Optimize the training process, potentially increasing the number of episodes or tweaking the learning algorithm.
    UI/UX Integration: Ensure that the AI's actions are well-integrated into the user interface, providing a seamless experience.

7. Additional Features (Optional)

    Difficulty Levels: Implement different difficulty levels by adjusting the AI's strategy or learning parameters.
    Learning from Human Players: If possible, have your AI learn from games played against human players to further enhance its strategy.

8. Documentation and Clean-Up

    Code Documentation: Document your code and the choices made in the RL agent's design.
    Code Clean-Up: Refine the code for readability and performance.

9. Deployment and User Testing

    Deploy Your Game: Once everything is working well, deploy your game.
    Gather User Feedback: Get feedback from users and observe how well the AI performs in real-world scenarios.

This agenda sets a clear path for integrating an RL agent into your Tic Tac Toe game. It's important to iterate and refine the AI based on testing and feedback. Remember, developing an effective RL agent can be complex and may require several iterations to achieve optimal performance.
