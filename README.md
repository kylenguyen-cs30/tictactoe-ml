This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Agenda

Next Steps for Building Machine Learning AI for Tic Tac Toe

Here's a proposed agenda to integrate a machine learning AI (specifically, a reinforcement learning agent) into your Tic Tac Toe project:
1. Overlap action: 
- prevent player accidentally clicking on any cell before ai make its move
2. Refine AI:
- AI still make bad decision.
